ValidationGroup
===============

When doing multipage forms that spread a models fields over several pages, validation becomes more difficult.  We would like to validate each step of the form, however, the rails validation run validation on all the fields.  This plugin enables you to define validation groups with certain fields, and then only run validation on those groups.

To install, type: ruby script/plugin install http://validationgroup.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/

Home page for plugin is: http://rubyforge.org/projects/validationgroup/

Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name, :description, :address, :email
  
  validation_group :step1, :fields=>[:name, :description]
  validation_group :step2, :fields=>[:address]     
end

This will run validation on :step1 fields
@user = User.new
@user.enable_validation_group :step1
@user.valid?

You can later disable validation groups by calling:
@user.disable_validation_group
